# 2022-Tax-Simulator-Project
Program gets the user's income from the year 2022 and calculates what tax bracket they are in and total paid towards federal taxes
  -project is complete but still needs expansion. Some future ideas i have are...adding options to add deductables such as tuition, claim a child, ect. Still learning the tax system but not as much free time due to school.
